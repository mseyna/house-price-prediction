House Prices Prediction using Machine Learning (Ames Housing dataset)
# House Price Prediction

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on various property characteristics.

This project is based on the Ames Housing dataset and follows a complete data science workflow, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handle missing values and categorical variables
- Apply feature scaling when necessary
- Train and compare several regression models
- Evaluate model performance using RMSE
- Select the best-performing model

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- ElasticNet
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting Regressor

## Evaluation Metric
The models are evaluated using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** on a validation set.

## Best Model
The Gradient Boosting Regressor achieved the best performance on the validation data.

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Project Status
This project is completed and serves as a learning and portfolio project.
